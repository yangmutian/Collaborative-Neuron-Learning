{"question": "Question: A pharmaceutical company is studying a new drug that inhibits the glucose transporter used by intestinal enterocytes to absorb glucose into the body. The drug was designed such that it would act upon the glucose transporter similarly to how cyanide acts upon cytochrome proteins.

Specifically, enterocyte cells are treated with the drug and then glucose is added to the solution at a concentration that saturates the activity of the transporter. The transport velocity and affinity of the transporters under these conditions are then measured. Compared to the untreated state, which of the following changes would most likely be seen in these transporters after treatment?\nOptions:\nA: Increased Km and decreased Vmax\nB: Increased Km and unchanged Vmax\nC: Unchanged Km and decreased Vmax\nD: Unchanged Km and unchanged Vmax\nPlease answer strictly with A, B, C, or D only.

{"question": "Question: A randomized, controlled trial was undertaken by a team of clinical researchers to evaluate a new drug for the treatment of cluster headaches. This type of headache (that mostly affects men) is characterized by excruciating pain on 1 side of the head. After careful randomization and controlling for all of the known confounders, a total of 200 patients with cluster headaches were divided into 2 groups. The first group of study participants received 40 mg of the new drug, X, in the form of a powder mixed with water. The second group received 80 mg of verapamil (a calcium channel blocker that is commonly prescribed for cluster headaches) in the form of a labeled pill. Participants from both groups were mixed together in rooms designated for drug research purposes and could communicate freely. After the study period has finished without any loss to follow-up or skipped treatments, the outcome (pain alleviation) was assessed by trained researchers that were blinded to treatment assignment.

{"question": "Question: A microbiology student was given a swab containing an unknown bacteria taken from the wound of a soldier and asked to identify the causative agent. She determined that the bacteria was a gram-positive, spore-forming bacili, but had difficulty narrowing it down to the specific bacteria. The next test she performed was the Nagler's test, in which she grew the bacteria on a plate made from egg yolk, which would demonstrate the ability of the bacteria to hydrolyze phospholipids and produce an area of opacity. Half the plate contained a specific antitoxin which prevented hydrolysis of phospholipids while the other half did not contain any antitoxin. The bacteria produced an area of opacity only on half of the plate containing no antitoxin. Which of the following toxins was the antitoxin targeting?\nOptions:\nA: Alpha toxin\nB: Tetanus toxin\nC: Exotoxin A\nD: Diphtheria toxin\nPlease answer strictly with A, B, C, or D only.
