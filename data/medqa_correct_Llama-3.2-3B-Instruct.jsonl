{"question": "Question: Background and Methods:\nAldosterone is important in the pathophysiology of heart failure. In a double-blind study, we enrolled 1,663 patients who had NYHA class III or IV heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35%, and who were being treated with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, a loop diuretic, and in most cases digoxin. A total of 822 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of spironolactone daily and 841 to receive placebo. The primary endpoint was death from all causes.\nResults:\nThe trial was discontinued early, after a mean follow-up period of 24 months, because an interim analysis determined that spironolactone was efficacious. There were 386 deaths in the placebo group (46%) and 284 in the spironolactone group (35%; relative risk of death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.82; P<0.001). This 30% reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure was 35% lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77; P<0.001). In addition, patients who received spironolactone had a significant improvement in the symptoms of heart failure, as assessed on the basis of the New York Heart Association functional class (P<0.001). Gynecomastia or breast pain was reported in 10% of men who were treated with spironolactone, as compared with 1 percent of men in the placebo group (P<0.001). The incidence of serious hyperkalemia was minimal in both groups of patients.\nTo which of the following patients are the results of this clinical trial applicable?\nOptions:\nA: An 82-year-old female with NYHA class II heart failure with an LVEF of 22%, taking lisinopril, furosemide, and digoxin\nB: A 65-year-old male with newly diagnosed NYHA class IV heart failure and a LVEF of 21%, about to begin medical therapy\nC: A 56-year-old male with NYHA class III heart failure with an LVEF of 32%, current taking lisinopril, furosemide, and digoxin\nD: An 86-year-old female recently found to have an LVEF of 34%, currently taking furosemide and carvedilol\nPlease answer strictly with A, B, C, or D only.

{"question": "Question: Background: Beta-blockers reduce mortality in patients who have chronic heart failure, systolic dysfunction, and are on background treatment with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We aimed to compare the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcome.\nMethods: In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized parallel group trial, we assigned 1511 patients with chronic heart failure to treatment with carvedilol (target dose, 25 mg twice daily) and 1518 to metoprolol (target dose, 50 mg twice daily). The patients were required to have chronic heart failure (NYHA II-IV), the previous admission for a cardiovascular indication, an ejection fraction of < 0.35, and to have been treated optimally with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors unless not tolerated. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or all-cause admission. The analysis was done by intention-to-treat.\nFindings: The mean study duration was 58 months (SD, 6). The mean ejection fraction was 0.26 (SD, 0.07) and the mean age was 62 years (SD, 11). The all-cause mortality was 34% (512 of 1511) for carvedilol and 40% (600 of 1518) for metoprolol (hazard ratio, 0.83 [95% CI 0.74-0.93], p = 0.0017). The reduction in all-cause mortality was consistent across pre-defined subgroups. The incidence of side effects and drug withdrawals did not differ significantly between the 2 study groups.\nBased on the best interpretation of the results of this clinical trial, which of the following statements is most accurate?\nOptions:\nA: There is no appreciable, statistically significant difference in overall mortality between the 2 treatment arms.\nB: Carvedilol demonstrated a significant improvement in all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure as compared to metoprolol.\nC: Metoprolol demonstrated a significant improvement in all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure compared to carvedilol.\nD: The results are likely biased due to trial design, and therefore non-generalizable.\nPlease answer strictly with A, B, C, or D only.

{"question": "Question: A 66-year-old farmer is being evaluated for abnormal lung findings on a low dose chest CT scan obtained as part of his lung cancer screening. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history and has been hesitant to quit. He has a non-productive cough but brushes it away saying he is not bothered by it. He denies ever coughing up blood, breathlessness, chest pain, fatigue, or weight loss. He has never sought any medical care and states that he has always been in good shape. He consumes alcohol moderately and uses marijuana occasionally. He lives with his wife and has not traveled recently. On physical examination, his temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), blood pressure is 148/70 mm Hg, and pulse rate is 95/min. His BMI is 32 kg/m2. A general physical examination is unremarkable.

A follow-up high-resolution CT scan is performed that shows small irregular subcentimeter pulmonary nodules, several of which are cavitated in both lungs, predominantly distributed in the upper and middle zones. There is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. A transbronchial needle aspiration of the lesion is performed which shows a nodular pattern of abundant, granular, mildly eosinophilic cells with grooved nuclei with indented nuclear membranes and a chronic inflammation that consists primarily of eosinophils.

{"question": "Question: A 62-year-old man with small cell lung cancer undergoes radiation therapy. His oncologist explains that radiation causes DNA damage and double strand breaks and this damage stops the cancer cells from growing because they can no longer replicate their DNA. One key mediator of this process is a cell cycle regulator called P53, which is upregulated after DNA damage and helps to trigger cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. One mechanism by which P53 activity is increased is a certain chromatin modification that loosens DNA coiling allowing for greater transcription of the proteins within that region of DNA. Which of the following enyzmes most likely causes the chromatin modification described in this case?\nOptions:\nA: DNA methyltransferase\nB: Histone acetyltransferase\nC: Histone deacetylase\nD: Xist\nPlease answer strictly with A, B, C, or D only.
