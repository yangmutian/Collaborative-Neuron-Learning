{"question": "Question: Background: Beta-blockers reduce mortality in patients who have chronic heart failure, systolic dysfunction, and are on background treatment with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We aimed to compare the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcome.\nMethods: In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized parallel group trial, we assigned 1511 patients with chronic heart failure to treatment with carvedilol (target dose, 25 mg twice daily) and 1518 to metoprolol (target dose, 50 mg twice daily). The patients were required to have chronic heart failure (NYHA II-IV), the previous admission for a cardiovascular indication, an ejection fraction of < 0.35, and to have been treated optimally with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors unless not tolerated. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or all-cause admission. The analysis was done by intention-to-treat.\nFindings: The mean study duration was 58 months (SD, 6). The mean ejection fraction was 0.26 (SD, 0.07) and the mean age was 62 years (SD, 11). The all-cause mortality was 34% (512 of 1511) for carvedilol and 40% (600 of 1518) for metoprolol (hazard ratio, 0.83 [95% CI 0.74-0.93], p = 0.0017). The reduction in all-cause mortality was consistent across pre-defined subgroups.

The patient states that he had spent the last 2 years in prison and that, during that time, he had engaged in multiple unprotected sexual acts with fellow male inmates. When he was released from prison recently, he decided to get tested for HIV and was diagnosed positive. He is currently married with 2 children and has been paroled back to the home he shares with them. He has not told either his wife or his children of his diagnosis. He adamantly states that he is not homosexual, but that his wife would assume that he is if she found out he had contracted HIV while in prison. He states that he is terrified his wife will leave him or possibly keep his children from seeing him if she finds out about his HIV status.  He wants to be treated without the threat of his wife finding out. He insists that he will use the proper precautions to ensure his wife and children don’t contract HIV from him and reiterates the importance of keeping his diagnosis a secret. He continues and states that “they are all I have.
