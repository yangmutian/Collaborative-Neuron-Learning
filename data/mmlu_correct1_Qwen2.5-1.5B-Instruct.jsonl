{"subject": "security_studies", "label": "A", "question": "Question: What impact did the end of the Cold War have on warlord politics?\nOptions:\nA: Within the context of state collapse, elites deliberately engender disorder for the pursuit of commercial activities and the exploitation of neo-liberal globalized shadow markets which would not otherwise be permissible in normal conditions. Warlord politics represented a new form of regime security forced upon weak state elites.\nB: Warlord politics represented the entrenchment of traditional patterns of redistributive networks within society but maintained by alternative political sources. Assistance derived from superpowers was superseded by US hegemonic endorsement at the end of the Cold War.\nC: Warlord politics in response to the rapid global changes inaugurated by the end of the Cold War and by globalization, was a temporary aberration in the normal function of the state and was reflective of the immediate need to secure infrastructural survival.\nD: Warlord politics was a new phenomenon which represented the opportunistic exploitation of hollowed out state institutions and fragmented armed forces. Commercial activities accumulated in a shadow economy facilitated by the end of the Cold War, not of strategic design.\n\nPlease reply with only A, B, C, or D.

{"subject": "security_studies", "label": "D", "question": "Question: Which statement best describes the relationship between realist international relations theorists and peace researchers in the early 1960s?\nOptions:\nA: Both peace researchers and realists advocated an academic focus on the escalation of the arms race. Although tensions existed between the groups in terms of their proposed solutions to this crisis, there existed a consensus that the Soviet bloc should be eliminated as a nuclear threat, thus favouring the survival of Western liberal democracies.\nB: In contrast to the realist school, peace researchers looked beyond the accumulation of nuclear weapons for a focus to their studies; this resulted in tensions between the two groups, with the former believing that the attainment of superior military strength was paramount to achieving security.\nC: Whilst peace researchers indentified the escalation of the arms race as a result of failures by the League of Nations, realist scholars deemed it to be the natural progression of ideological differences between the Soviet bloc and Western liberal democracies. This resulted in irreconcilable differences between the study agendas of realists and peace researchers.\nD: The East-West divide of the Cold War gave rise to a sharp divide between realists and early peace studies theorists. Whilst realists wished to focus research on that which would favour the survival of Western liberal democracies, advocates of peace studies regarded this approach as being narrow and Western ethnocentric.\n\nPlease reply with only A, B, C, or D.

It is very unlikely that the internal dynamics of the theory debate will be decided by a general prevalence of one of the current debates.\nC: Both the US and European analysts will be working on the role and nature of technology, globalization, risk society and the international economic order.
