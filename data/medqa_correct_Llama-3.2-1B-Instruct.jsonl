{"question": "Question: While explaining the effects of hypokalemia and hyperkalemia on the cardiac rhythm, a cardiologist explains that the electrophysiology of cardiac tissue is unique. He mentions that potassium ions play an important role in the electrophysiology of the heart, and the resting membrane potential of the cardiac myocytes is close to the equilibrium potential of K+ ions.

At the time of presentation, his vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg, heart rate 108/min, respiratory rate 29/min, and temperature 35.5°C (95.9°F). On physical examination, the patient sits upright. He is lethargic and cyanotic. Lung auscultation reveals widespread bilateral fine rales. Cardiac examination is significant for S3, accentuation of the pulmonic component of S2, and a systolic murmur heard best at the apex of the heart. Soon after hospitalization, the patient develops ventricular fibrillation and dies despite adequate resuscitation measures. Which microscopic finding would you expect to see in this patient on autopsy?\nOptions:\nA: Brownish inclusions in the pulmonary macrophages on H&E staining\nB: Positive Prussian-blue staining of the kidney tissue\nC: Ground-glass hepatocytes\nD: Positive Congo-red staining of the cardiac tissue\nPlease answer strictly with A, B, C, or D only.
