{"question": "Question: A pharmaceutical company is studying a new drug that inhibits the glucose transporter used by intestinal enterocytes to absorb glucose into the body. The drug was designed such that it would act upon the glucose transporter similarly to how cyanide acts upon cytochrome proteins. During pre-clinical studies, the behavior of this drug on the activity of the glucose transporter is examined. Specifically, enterocyte cells are treated with the drug and then glucose is added to the solution at a concentration that saturates the activity of the transporter. The transport velocity and affinity of the transporters under these conditions are then measured. Compared to the untreated state, which of the following changes would most likely be seen in these transporters after treatment?\nOptions:\nA: Increased Km and decreased Vmax\nB: Increased Km and unchanged Vmax\nC: Unchanged Km and decreased Vmax\nD: Unchanged Km and unchanged Vmax\nPlease answer strictly with A, B, C, or D only.

{"question": "Question: Background and Methods:\nAldosterone is important in the pathophysiology of heart failure. In a double-blind study, we enrolled 1,663 patients who had NYHA class III or IV heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35%, and who were being treated with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, a loop diuretic, and in most cases digoxin. A total of 822 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of spironolactone daily and 841 to receive placebo. The primary endpoint was death from all causes.\nResults:\nThe trial was discontinued early, after a mean follow-up period of 24 months, because an interim analysis determined that spironolactone was efficacious. There were 386 deaths in the placebo group (46%) and 284 in the spironolactone group (35%; relative risk of death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.82; P<0.001). This 30% reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure was 35% lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77; P<0.001). In addition, patients who received spironolactone had a significant improvement in the symptoms of heart failure, as assessed on the basis of the New York Heart Association functional class (P<0.001). Gynecomastia or breast pain was reported in 10% of men who were treated with spironolactone, as compared with 1 percent of men in the placebo group (P<0.001). The incidence of serious hyperkalemia was minimal in both groups of patients.\nTo which of the following patients are the results of this clinical trial applicable?\nOptions:\nA: An 82-year-old female with NYHA class II heart failure with an LVEF of 22%, taking lisinopril, furosemide, and digoxin\nB: A 65-year-old male with newly diagnosed NYHA class IV heart failure and a LVEF of 21%, about to begin medical therapy\nC: A 56-year-old male with NYHA class III heart failure with an LVEF of 32%, current taking lisinopril, furosemide, and digoxin\nD: An 86-year-old female recently found to have an LVEF of 34%, currently taking furosemide and carvedilol\nPlease answer strictly with A, B, C, or D only.

{"question": "Question: Background: Beta-blockers reduce mortality in patients who have chronic heart failure, systolic dysfunction, and are on background treatment with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We aimed to compare the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcome.\nMethods: In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized parallel group trial, we assigned 1511 patients with chronic heart failure to treatment with carvedilol (target dose, 25 mg twice daily) and 1518 to metoprolol (target dose, 50 mg twice daily). The patients were required to have chronic heart failure (NYHA II-IV), the previous admission for a cardiovascular indication, an ejection fraction of < 0.35, and to have been treated optimally with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors unless not tolerated. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or all-cause admission. The analysis was done by intention-to-treat.\nFindings: The mean study duration was 58 months (SD, 6). The mean ejection fraction was 0.26 (SD, 0.07) and the mean age was 62 years (SD, 11). The all-cause mortality was 34% (512 of 1511) for carvedilol and 40% (600 of 1518) for metoprolol (hazard ratio, 0.83 [95% CI 0.74-0.93], p = 0.0017).

One mechanism by which P53 activity is increased is a certain chromatin modification that loosens DNA coiling allowing for greater transcription of the proteins within that region of DNA.
